# ðŸŽž Matrix factorization techniques in recommendation systems
The project was made as a part of Linear Algebra course (UCU, 2020)

Final report https://www.overleaf.com/read/prccmvgchfyw.

## Overview
There is represented an implementation of several MF algorithms for collaborative filtering:
- Non-Negative Matrix Factorization 
- Funk SVD
- Alternating Least Squares for SVD
- Neural SVD (bonus track)

The results were evaluated on custom subsets of Netflix Prize data, generated with a different sparsity. For more detailed information and references please follow the final report.
